## Dependencies

This program depends on both [GNU Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/). On Mac OSX you can install them using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) like so:

    $ brew install flex bison

You may need to link them manually depending on your configuration, which you can do with:

    $ brew link flex --force
